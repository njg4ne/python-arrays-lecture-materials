## Contents

- **sequence-lab.ipynb**: Interactive Jupyter notebook covering Python sequence operations, including create/read/update/delete (CRUD), slicing, loops, reductions, transformations, and homework problems.
- **jumbotron.py**: Python script simulating a pixel grid (jumbotron) for animation, with editable functions for drawing borders and moving dots, using emoji for pixels.
- **emoji-jumbotron.html**: Web-based emoji jumbotron simulator with a 9x16 grid, allowing interactive toggling of pixels via mouse and keyboard.
- **README.md**: This file.

## Topics Covered

- Python list and sequence basics
- Indexing, slicing, and mutating lists
- Looping over sequences (for, while, enumerate)
- Built-in sequence functions (min, max, sum, all, any, sorted, map, filter)
- Sequence concatenation and repetition
- 2D arrays and grid-based animation logic
- Interactive visualization of arrays using emoji

## Usage

- Open `sequence-lab.ipynb` in Jupyter for hands-on Python sequence exercises.
- Run `jumbotron.py` to simulate pixel animations in the terminal.
- Open `emoji-jumbotron.html` in a browser for an interactive grid experience.
- Review and extend the code for teaching or learning about Python arrays and sequences.
