## Contents

- **sequence-lab.ipynb**: Interactive Jupyter notebook covering Python sequence operations, including create/read/update/delete (CRUD), slicing, loops, reductions, transformations, and homework problems.
- **jumbotron.py**: Python script simulating a pixel grid (jumbotron) for animation, with editable functions for drawing borders and moving dots, using emoji for pixels.
- **index.html**: Web-based emoji jumbotron simulator with a 9x16 grid. This file is also used as the GitHub Pages site for this repo. Allows interactive toggling of pixels via mouse and keyboard (see usage below).
- **README.md**: This file.

## Topics Covered

- Python list and sequence basics
- Indexing, slicing, and mutating lists
- Looping over sequences (for, while, enumerate)
- Built-in sequence functions (min, max, sum, all, any, sorted, map, filter)
- Sequence concatenation and repetition
- 2D arrays and grid-based animation logic
- Interactive visualization of arrays using emoji

## Usage

- Open `sequence-lab.ipynb` in Jupyter for hands-on Python sequence exercises.
- Run `jumbotron.py` to simulate pixel animations in the terminal.
- Open `index.html` in a browser for an interactive grid experience.
  - **Tip:** Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and mouse over cells to draw.
  - Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd> and mouse over cells to undraw.
- Review and extend the code for teaching or learning about Python arrays and sequences.
